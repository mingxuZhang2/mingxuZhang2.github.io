Hello, this is Mingxu Zhang, a current student major in Computer Science, Nankai University, class of 2021. My current research interests include AI Alignment, Scalable Oversight, Weak-to-strong Generation, and I am eager to explore entirely new fields. At present, I am actively preparing for direct admission to a graduate program or applying for a MPhil/PhD in the Hong Kong region. Please contact me via email!
