  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in their application to molecular modeling
  and property prediction. However, existing molecular LLMs either rely solely on SMILES strings—thus ignoring rich atomic and
  structural context—or introduce molecular features via auxiliary adapters, which fails to achieve true modality integration and
  interpretability. Here, we present AtomDisc, an interpretable atom-level tokenizer that discretizes local chemical environments
  into structure-aware tokens directly embedded within SMILES sequences. This unified representation enables LLMs to jointly
  model chemical syntax and atomic structure, providing both fine-grained performance gains and unprecedented interpretability.
  Through systematic case studies and attribution analysis, AtomDisc not only achieves state-of-the-art results on molecular
  generation and property prediction tasks, but also reveals new structure–property relationships, demonstrating its potential for
  AI-driven scientific discovery in chemistry.
