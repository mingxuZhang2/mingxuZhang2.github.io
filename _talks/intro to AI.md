In the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course, we conducted paper readings in groups. Our topic was related to image generation. We read several classic papers on image generation and selected the four most classic ones to complete a literature review. Our review was rated as an excellent major assignment. As the group leader, I reported our research progress in class. You can find the corresponding slides [here](/talks/Slides for image generation) and the paper [here](/talks/Introduction to AI A survey on Image Generation).
